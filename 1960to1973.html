	  Historically, 1960 and 1973 only represent a gap of 13 years, but in this timeframe, governmental policy changed for the benefit of women and minorities in a monumental way. 
	  This was due largely to legislation started by John F. Kennedy in the midst of racial tension, but brought into fruition by Lyndon B. Johnson. 
	  The argument could be made that the choices were made in Johnson’s own political self-interest, produced the byproducts which empowered the powerless; 
	  as such, a large contrast in self-image and popular perception of these demographic groups, changed – and the reflection of such advances is evident within the media. 
	  This having been said, the television shows selected for contrast are the following: The Lawless Years (1959) Episodes 1 and 2, and also, Diana Rigg (1973) Episodes 1 and 2. 
	  These two samples from seemingly very different time periods will be contrasted by visual quality, general clothing contrast of the eras, women and their roles, technological advances, racial differences, overall episode plots.

        <p>
          From a chronological standpoint, the most obvious difference is the picture quality of the media. The 1959 show lacked color, and the screen seemed to have a vignette-style filter applied over the production development process; 
	  such is a typical quality of similar shows. The audio fills the audience with intense and dramatic modern-classical music. In a significant corresponding contrast, the Diana Rigg show had distinguishable, but murky, colors on-screen. 
	  The soundtrack was far less complex in instrumentation, and the notes were more vibrant and upbeat. While the literal media qualities and their evolution over time were considerable, these advances were not as pressing in the collective 
	  American consciousness as the on-going political changes which affected everyday life. However, the changes in media quality helped better depict the underlying themes, which set the stage for an enhanced analytical perspective.

	  In the 1960 show, the men, in spite of being criminals, wore dress clothes, well-trimmed haircuts, and most were clean-shaven – same as the rest of the common population depicted in other parts of the show. 
	  The women wore elegant dresses, and like the men, wore ordinary, visually-neutral colors.  However, in the more modern show, the men sometimes wore long hair, differing hairstyles, facial hair, brighter colors, 
	  modern and casual clothes overextending normal fit, more jewelry, and sunglasses. The women wore also casual clothing, and modern patterns on their clothes. This change reflects the population, and their willingness to accept the ‘new’. 
	  To do away with old style, likely meant to also do away with old ideology.

	  Women in the older show were simply housewives in many scenes. Dialogue was mainly exchanged between men. It wasn’t too uncommon to see the women helping the man do what he decided. The men simply went about their business. 
	  In the ’73 show, the females were actually leads in the show and often joked about and with the men, in addition, females had jobs. The show even goes as far as depicting the women making sexual jokes at the men. 
	  Such content would’ve been readily rejected in 1960. Such a difference depicts the increase of power women held in the era. Equality established helped empower them to not only dress casually, but to also take on roles which were strictly for men in the past.

	  In 1960, the few scenes with African Americans had much to say. For instance, they would be treated without much consideration, would be dressed poorly, or would be the object of a joke. However, in the 1973 show, 
	  they were often main characters and wore the same type of clothing as any other man. Such a change is exactly the focal point of this era. An empowering thing so perfectly portrayed in the media. 
	  The Civil Rights movements’ fruit was exposed on television.

	  The plot of the shows, unlike the previous points, are not too relatable, as the 1960 show is a drama, and the 1973 show is a comedy. The first show depicts a man working for criminals and their business.
	  In contrast, the 1973 show is about a female and her humorous struggles with her new job.

	  As previously mentioned, the largest impacts were most apparent within the contrast in minority groups: women and non-whites. Those in the background, now occupied the foreground. The peaceful demonstration and protests amounted to a domino-effect which,
	  with the self-interests of Lyndon V. Johnson, created perhaps the most revolutionary period in American history. With the creation of new legislation, came benefits for the population, and the statistics of the era objectively prove this point. 
	  That said, both shows are actually entertaining in spite of not being modern and up to today’s standards.
